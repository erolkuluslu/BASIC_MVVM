# Basic MVVM Flutter App 

This Flutter application, crafted with insights from HardwareAndro's code and videos, follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. It includes a basic user interface for entering a user name, performing validation, and interacting with a service layer. The application is structured into different classes and files to maintain a clean and modular codebase, with inspiration and guidance from HardwareAndro's resources.

## Overview

This Flutter app, designed with assistance from HardwareAndro's code and videos, demonstrates a simple MVVM architecture for handling user input, validation, and interaction with a service layer. The application includes the following components:

## Components

### Model

#### `BasicModel`

- An immutable class representing the basic model with a user name.
- Implements equality and hashCode for proper comparison.
- Provides a `copyWith` method for creating a new instance with updated properties.

### ViewModel

#### `BasicViewModel`

- Manages the business logic and interaction with the service layer.
- Contains a method `controlToUserName` for validating the user name asynchronously.
- Saves the user name to the cache using the `BasicCacheInterface`.

#### `BasicCacheInterface`

- An interface defining the contract for caching operations.

#### `BasicCache`

- Implements `BasicCacheInterface`.
- Provides a simple implementation for caching operations.

### View

#### `BasicView`

- The main UI screen that includes an input field and a button.
- Utilizes the `BasicViewMixin` for handling UI logic.
- Uses the `BasicInputField` widget for user input.

#### `BasicInputField`

- A reusable widget representing the input field for entering a user name.
- Utilizes a `TextFormField` for user input.

### Mixin

#### `BasicViewMixin`

- A mixin for the `BasicView` state to encapsulate UI-related logic.
- Manages a `TextEditingController` for the user name input field.
- Utilizes a `ValueNotifier` for tracking input validation status.

## Usage

To use this app with insights from HardwareAndro, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Flutter development environment.
3. Leverage the coding techniques and best practices shared by HardwareAndro.
4. Configure the app for your specific requirements.
5. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Important Note

- **Avoid using showDialog in the ViewModel:** The `BasicViewModel` class explicitly states that it should not include `showDialog` or similar UI-related logic. UI-related operations should be handled in the `View` or via callbacks to maintain a clean separation of concerns.
